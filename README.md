As part of GPOâ€™s partnership with the Law Library of Congress to digitize the United States Congressional Serial Set and make the volumes available in [govinfo](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/serialset), Library Services and Content Management (LSCM) posts the MARC records in this repository.

The first record set includes 9,492 records, 9,443 monographs and 49 serials, in various Congressional publication series, including House and Senate documents and reports. The total size of the files is 19 MB (19,732 KB). LSCM staff members analyzed and reviewed the records as a whole and batch processed global updates and enhancements. The publications range in date from 1818 to 1927. All records have Superintendent of Documents classification numbers for the Congressional publication series and Serial Set series. Most records have OCLC numbers. The records do not contain Federal Depository Library Program item numbers.

The records are discoverable in the CGP via the [Congressional Serial Set Catalog](https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/LPS93629) and the standard search modes. In the [expert search mode](https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/LPS93626), you can use a local field search to retrieve all of the Serial Set records and combine that search with other metadata elements: `wlts=SERIALSET?`

The `volume_numbers_serial_set.csv` file lists the Serial Set volume numbers represented in the records.

We ask that you please submit your feedback and questions about the records via [askGPO](https://ask.gpo.gov/s/) in the Cataloging/Metadata (Policy and Records) category.

To download the files, use the `Code` button in the right-hand section of this page and select `Download ZIP.` The ZIP file contains all of the files in the repository.
