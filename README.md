# cataloging-records-serial-set-marcxml

As part of GPOâ€™s partnership with the Law Library of Congress to digitize the United States Congressional Serial Set and make the volumes available in GovInfo, Library Services and Content Management (LSCM) posts the MARC records of the [U.S. Catalog of Government Publications (CGP)](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F) in this repository. For more information about the Serial Set Project, please visit the [Digitizing the United States Congressional Serial Set](https://fdlp.gov/project-list/digitizing-the-united-states-congressional-serial-set) page on FDLP.gov.

This repository contains three files:

- A cumulative file of all project records in the CGP
  - 30,209 records (30,007 monographs | 202 serials)
  - 68,563 KB
- A file of the most recently added CGP records
  - 16,498 records (16,402 monographs | 96 serials)
  - 33,514 KB
- A cumulative list of the volumes represented in the CGP records
  - Please note: this list does not include the volume numbers of serial issues

The records are also available in MARC in the [cataloging-records-serial-set-utf8](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records-serial-set-utf8) repository. LSCM staff members analyzed and reviewed the records as a whole and batch processed global updates and enhancements. The publications range in date from 1817 (15th Congress) to 1984 (98th Congress). All records have Superintendent of Documents classification numbers for the Congressional publication series and Serial Set series and OCLC numbers. The records do not contain Federal Depository Library Program item numbers.

The records are discoverable in the CGP via the [Congressional Serial Set Catalog](https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/LPS93629) and the standard search modes. In the [expert search mode](https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/LPS93626), you can use a local field search to retrieve all of the Serial Set records and combine that search with other metadata elements: [wlts=SERIALSET?](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F/?func=find-c&ccl_term=wlts%3Dserialset%3F&x=50&y=13)

We ask that you please submit your feedback and questions about the records via [askGPO](https://ask.gpo.gov/s/) in the Cataloging/Metadata (Policy and Records) category.

To download the files, use the `Code` button in the right-hand section of this page and select `Download ZIP.` The ZIP file contains all of the files in the repository.
