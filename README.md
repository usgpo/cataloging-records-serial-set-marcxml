# U.S. Congressional Serial Set Records (MARC XML)

## General Information

As part of GPO’s partnership with the Law Library of Congress to digitize the United States Congressional Serial Set and make the volumes available in GovInfo, Library Services and Content Management (LSCM) posts the MARC records of the [U.S. Catalog of Government Publications (CGP)](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F) in this repository. For more information about the Serial Set Project, please visit the [Digitizing the United States Congressional Serial Set](https://fdlp.gov/project-list/digitizing-the-united-states-congressional-serial-set) page on FDLP.gov.

This repository contains three files:

- A cumulative file of all project records in the CGP
  - 30,209 records (30,007 monographs | 202 serials)
  - 8,600 KB (Zipped)
- A file of the most recently added CGP records
  - 16,498 records (16,402 monographs | 96 serials)
  - 4,016 KB (Zipped)
- A cumulative list of the volumes represented in the CGP records
  - Please note: this list does not include the volume numbers of serial issues

The records are also available in MARC UTF-8 in the [cataloging-records-serial-set-utf8](https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records-serial-set-utf8) repository. LSCM staff members analyzed and reviewed the records as a whole and batch processed global updates and enhancements. The publications range in date from 1817 (15th Congress) to 1984 (98th Congress). All records have Superintendent of Documents classification numbers for the Congressional publication series and Serial Set series and OCLC numbers. The records do not contain Federal Depository Library Program item numbers.

The records are discoverable in the CGP via the [Congressional Serial Set Catalog](https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/LPS93629) and the standard search modes. In the [expert search mode](https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/LPS93626), you can use a local field search to retrieve all of the Serial Set records and combine that search with other metadata elements: [wlts=SERIALSET?](https://catalog.gpo.gov/F/?func=find-c&ccl_term=wlts%3Dserialset%3F&x=50&y=13)
